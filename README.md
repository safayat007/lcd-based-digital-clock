# Introduction :
Making a micocontroller based Digital Clock and understanding the basic of Real Time Clock module is fun as an engineering student. Real time clock ICâ€™s are present in computers, servers, many embedded systems and in fact they are used wherever it is required to keep an accurate time. 
# DS1307 Real Time Clock :
The DS1307 RTC is a low cost, low power real time clock IC that can maintain full clock and calendar i.e. hours, minutes, seconds as well as year, month and day. 
# Apparatus : 
* Arduino Uno
* DS1307 RTC module 
* Resistors and
* Jumper Wires
# Schematics :
